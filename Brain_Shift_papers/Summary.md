### 1. The first evaluation of brain shift during functional neurosurgery by deformation field analysis (2005)

- [Short Case Report] to demonstrate how important it is to plant the electrodes accurately (2mm) in case of advanced Parkinson’s disease. 

- With functional neurosurgery even minimal brain shift in the region of the STN cannot be neglected.
- The accuracy of **static** image guided devices decreases with the length of surgery owing to intraoperative brain shift[1]
- Methods for quantifying this brain movement (teleradiography, pointer based measurement of brain shift, **intraoperative ultrasound**) do exist, but are **not suitable** for evaluating the shift from the surface to the middle of the brain during functional neurosurgery. 
- Only intraoperative CT or MRI can give detailed information on intraoperative shift that can be used to modify the planned trajectories. This requires that one of these examinations is repeated during surgery, with the patient still fixed in the stereotactic frame. 
- Up to now, illustrative models for shift measurement in the brain, especially in the basal ganglia, have not been established.
- the brain shift as a **dynamic error** occurring during functional neurosurgery.
- Brain shift as a reason for ‘‘dynamic error’’ is caused by loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the inherent qualities of the brain, failure to reclose the burr hole, the time consuming procedures of multichannel microelectrode recording and stimulation testing, and by the procedure itself, which favours further CSF derangement. 
- **Deformation field analysis** has proved to be a reliable method for analysing intraoperative brain shift. Up to now no other study has demonstrated this phenomenon with such accuracy.

### 2. Intraoperative Compensation for Brain Shift (2001)

- Tumor removal, brain swelling, the use of brain retractors, and cerebrospinal-fluid drainage all result in an intraoperative brain deformation that is known as brain shift. Thus, neuronavigation systems relying on preoperative image data have a decreasing accuracy during the surgical procedure.
- Navigation systems have been used to measure the extent of brain shift, relying on pointer-based [2,3], mechanical arm-based [4], or autofocus/laser-based techniques [5].
- The suspicious area was **segmented** and the approach was planned. 
- Then, **registration** with these markers completed the navigational update. As an estimate of the accuracy of the updated neuronavigation the mean registration error, a technical measure calculated by the navigation software using the fiducial coordinates (root mean square error) was documented.
- The accuracy was checked by repeated landmark verifications; that is, it was verified whether the position of fiducial or anatomic landmarks that could be easily identified with the
autofocus pointer of the microscope was depicted correctly by the MR image data.
- intraoperative ultrasound has the advantage of being a real-time modality. Ultrasound data may provide information on how to modify high-quality preoperative MR image data to represent the real intraoperative situation, thus compensating for the effects of brain shift. 
- This approach relies on the non-linear registration of intraoperative ultrasound data with preoperative MR volume data. 
- The MR data are modified by using a mathematical model describing the movement of the brain during surgery [6,7,8].
- Instead of using ultrasound images to adapt preoperative image data, so-called sparse data (i.e., measured movements of some known landmarks) are used in mathematical models that try to predict the deformation of the brain [8,9]
